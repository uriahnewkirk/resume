Personal website
https://uriahnewkirk.github.io/

I took the liberty to test my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript by designing a personal website. This website not only acts as an example of my work in those languages, but also highlights other interesting projects that I have worked on throughout the years. I hope that you enjoy it and please don't hesitate to leave any feedback on anything that I might need to fix.
